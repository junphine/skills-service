* Skill Groups
* Configured display order of subjects and skills is preserved in the copied project
* Levels
* Badges
* Project-Based Dependencies
* Re-used Skills
* Project Settings are copied with the exception of the exclusions specified below

The following training profile elements are **NOT** copied into a new project:

* Catalog imported skills are not copied
* Cross-Project Dependencies are not copied
* If the original project Visibility setting was changed to be `Discoverable on Progress And Ranking` the copied project will instead use the default value of `Public Not Discoverable`
