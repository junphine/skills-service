Project is an overall container that represents skills' ruleset for a single application with gamified training. The project's administrator(s) manage training skills definitions, subjects, levels, dependencies and other attributes that make up an application's training profile. To create a project click the `Project +` button.

A Project is composed of Subjects which are made up of Skills and a single skill defines a training unit within the gamification framework. Once the project is created you have an empty canvas on which to compose and manage your application's training profile. Generally the next step is to create a number of Subjects and then start constructing Skill definitions within those Subjects.

The Dashboard user that creates a project is automatically granted the role of administrator of that project. Project administrators enjoy the following benefits:
