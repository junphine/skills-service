Skill Groups are a way to group/organize skills under a subject. Projects are composed of Subjects which are made of either Skills or Skill Groups. A group is a collection of 2 or more skills that you want to keep and achieve together. A group is achieved when all of its skills are fully completed. Alternatively, a group can be configured to only require `N` number of the group's skills.

> **Partial Requirement Example**
> If let's say a group has `5` skills, you can configure it to only require `3` skills. In this case, when any of the `3` skills under that group are completed then the group achievement is awarded!

To create a group, navigate to `Project -> Subject` then click on `Group +`, the following group properties can be specified:

| Property | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Group Name | Display name of the skill |
| Group ID | Group ID that will be used to identify this group |
| Description | *(Optional)* Description of how to perform this skill. |

After a group is created then skills can be added to the group. To add Skills to the group expand the group and click on the `Add Skill To Group` button.

> **TIP**
> When first created, a Group is not visible on the Skills Display because it has 0 skills. Once at least 1 skill is added the group will be rendered in the Skills Display.

## Partial Skill Requirement

Groups have an option to only require `N` skills out of the total available number of skills added to the group. For example, if a group has `5` skills, you can configure it to only require the completion of `3` skills. In this case, when any `3` skills under that group are completed then the group achievement is awarded!
