Used in conjunction with the `Time Window` property; Once this `Max Occurrences` is reached, points will not be incremented until outside of the configured `Time Window`.

When designing a gamification profile, the Time Window must be considered in conjunction with the `Occurrences to Completion` property. For example, you may want to require 30 occurrences to complete a skill but only up to 5 occurrences within a 24 hour window. This means that it will take a user at a minimum, 6 days to complete this skill.

Here are the properties for this hypothetical example:

* <em>Occurrences to Completion</em>: 30
* <em>Time Window</em>: 24 hours 0 minutes
* <em>Max Occurrences Within Window</em>: 5

This is just a fictitious example and values will depend on your gamification needs.
