A Project is composed of Subjects which are made of Skills and a single skill defines a training unit within the gamification framework. Subjects are a way to group and organize skill definitions within a gamified training profile.

Subjects offer the following features:

* **Skills** \- create and manage Skill definitions\.
* **Levels Model** \- Subject specific level model definition so users are awarded subject level achievements\.
* **Icons** \- assign subject specific icon based on fontawesome or material icon sets or use a custom icon\.
* **Stats** \- Subject specific charts and graph and user stats\.

To create a Subject navigate to `Project -> Subjects` and then click the `Subject +` button.

> To navigate to a specific skill you can drill down into a subject card or use the `Search and Navigate directly to a skill` component

##### Best Practices

* Use the same icon style/set for all subjects. We support font awesome, material and custom icons
* Strive for each subject to have a similar number of points. The `Project -> Subjects` page shows subject cards and each card exposes the `Points %` which reflects the subject's percentage of the total available Project points.
