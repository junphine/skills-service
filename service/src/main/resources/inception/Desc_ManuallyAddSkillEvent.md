There maybe a special situation when you want to give user a credit explicitly. Project admins can add Skill Events manually through the Dashboard.

To earn points please navigate to `Project -> Subject -> Skill -> Add Event` and add a skill event for a user:

1. Locate the Subject that contains the Skill for which you would like to add an event
2. Select `Manage` for the located Subject
3. Locate the Skill and select `Manage`
    * The `Filter` box on the top left of the Skills table can be used to quickly locate a particular Skill
4. Select `Add Event` from the Navigation menu on the left
5. Enter the `User Id` of the user for whom the Skill Event will be added (note that the field supports type-ahead to locate existing users)
6. Enter a date on which the Skill Event occurred (this will default to today's date)
7. Select `Add`
