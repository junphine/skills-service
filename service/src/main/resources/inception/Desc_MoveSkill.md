Move Skills is a feature that allows project administrators to move skills to other subjects or skill groups within the same project. When skills are moved, users' points are preserved for those skills and level-based achievements are properly re-calculted for both origination and destination subject/group.

> **TIP**
> The ability to move skills between subjects gives project administrators gives project administrators the ability to refine their training profile after the initial creation of skills.

To move one or more skills please navigate to the Skills page (`Project -> Subject`), then select the skills to move and click on the Action button located on the top-right above the skills' table. Select the `Move Skills` button to initiate the process.

> **TIP**
> All the skills under a subject or group can be easily selected via the `Select All` button
