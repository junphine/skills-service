This Skill is an example of the `Self Reporting` feature. Click the **`Claim Points`** button below to receive points. The skill is configured under the 'Honor' system and the points will be awarded immediately. Enjoy!

Self Report is a feature that empowers users to mark skills as completed directly in the SkillTree dashboard OR through
the embedded Skills Display component. A project administrator can enable `Self Reporting` for a skill, set of skills or
even all the skills in a project. Skills that have been configured with Self Reporting display a button allowing users
to self report completion of those skills.

There are two `Self report` types available:

1. `Honor System` \- points are awarded immediately
2. `Approval Queue` \- request goes into the project's approval queue; project administrators can approve or deny requests\. Note When choosing Approval Queue\, you may also choose to require users to submit a justification when self\-reporting this skill by selecting the 'Justification Required' check box\.

Project administrators can craft training profiles consisting of:

* only self-reported skills *OR*
* a mix of self-reported skills and skills that are reported programmatically *OR*
* a project could have no self-reported skills at all
