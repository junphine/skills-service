The Contact Users Page allows a Project Administrator to email the users of a Project by employing a variety of different filters to select all or some of the Project users.

Up to 15 different filters can be combined to target users of your project based on the achievement of levels across the Project/Subjects as well as the achievement specific Badges and Skills or the lack of achievement of specific Skills.

Once a Project Administrator has selected the desired filters, they can create an email that can be sent to the selected users. The specified email can also be previewed using the `Preview` button. This will send the specified email to the currently authenticated user so that formatting, content, and display can be validated.

To earn points simply navigate to `Project -> Contact Users`.
