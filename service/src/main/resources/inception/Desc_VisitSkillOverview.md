Projects are composed of Subjects which are made of Skills and a single skill defines a training unit within the gamification framework. To complete a skill, users may need to perform the same action multiple times - repetition is important for retention after all. A Skill definition specifies how many times a skill has to be performed. Each occurrence is called a Skill Event.

Skill Overview shows overview attributes of a skill definition depicting such information as:

* Skill **Name** and Skill **ID**
