This configuration is used by the Skills Display and Skills Reporting libraries so you won't need to configure those separately.  
 
 ```SkillsConfiguration``` ```configure``` parameters:

| Parameter        |Type| Explanation           |
| ------------- |:-------------- |:-------------|
| serviceUrl    | String (representing URL) | url to the skills service - this is the same url as the dashboard - the User Interface and service endpoints are co-located | 
| projectId      | String | the id of the project that was created in the dashboard; visualize and report skills for the project with this id |   
| authenticator | String | <conditional visibilityFlag="passwordAuthInstall">url to your [Authentication Endpoint](/skills-client/auth.html#authentication)</conditional><conditional visibilityFlag="pkiAuthInstallOnly">always set this value to ``pki`` (the SkillTree platform can be installed in other modes, that is when changing this value would come into play)</conditional> |   

SkillsConfiguration supplies the ***afterConfigure()*** method which returns a promise which will be resolved once the **SkillsConfiguration** ***configure*** method
completes.  This allows support, for example, for configuration options to be supplied by the server asynchronously.
